name: passport-description
description: Builder skill. Write this element's passport texts — name, short description, long description, what it accepts, what it returns, Nostr tags — in OWN-SERVICE-PROPS/OWN-SERVICE-PROPS.json, so that the element is found by semantic search. Use when the person presses «Generate description» on the passport page of the node core, or asks to describe the element, rewrite its description, or prepare it for search or a marketplace.

# Passport description

A hint, not a law: models of late 2026 work worse under rigid step-by-step instructions.

The passport (`OWN-SERVICE-PROPS/README.md`) is the element's main door: the node core indexes it, anyone gets it with one request,
and later it goes to Nostr. Its texts are how a stranger — a person or an agent searching by meaning — finds this element and
decides to work with it.

## Describe the job, not the builder

Every element born from the starter can build itself — pages, design, data, its own code. That ability is innate and identical
everywhere, so it is never in the passport: a searcher cannot tell two elements apart by it. Describe only the job this element
was made for — what it does for whoever calls it. «Takes a text instruction and returns an image» is a description; «a site with
pages, roles and a design system» is the starter, not this element.

## Learn the element from its own files first

Pages and their texts (`app/[lang]/**/_pages/`, `content/`), the A2A endpoint and the skills it serves (`app/api/a2a`, `lib/a2a/`),
the doors under `app/api/`, the agent's skills in `.claude/skills/`. Write only what the code does today — a claim the element cannot
keep sends a buyer to the wrong place.

## The fields you write

| Field | Limit | What it says |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | short | the element's name as a person would say it |
| `shortDescription` | ≤ 500 characters | the task it solves and for whom, in one or two sentences |
| `longDescription` | ≤ 10 000 characters | what it does, how one works with it, what it does not do |
| `accepts` | a few sentences | an example of what one sends it for its job: a question, a file, an order — in plain words |
| `returns` | a few sentences | an example of the result of its job: what the caller gets back |
| `nostr.tags` | 5–15 lowercase words | topics a searcher would type |

Leave `nostr.description` empty unless the person asks for a different text: empty means «the short description» (one text, not
two copies). Never touch `id`, `visibility`, `calls`, `marketplace` — those are the person's decisions.

## Written for search by meaning

Name the problem in the words of the one who has it, then the solution. Use the plain words a searcher types and their common
synonyms; avoid our internal terms (AGI ITEM, node, element) unless the reader needs them. Concrete nouns and verbs, no slogans.
No personal data — the file is public.

## Before writing

Show the person the texts in the terminal and ask «save?». Write the file only after «yes», keep valid JSON, commit with a message
naming the passport, and tell the person to reload the passport page.
