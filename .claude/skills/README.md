Claude Code reads the skills of the agent that works in this folder from here: one folder per skill, `SKILL.md` inside.

Proof: ✅ — proven by a live run, the report is in `development-docs/proofs/`; «✅ 2026-10-07» — written, never checked live (in the
skill itself: a `<!-- PROOF … -->` mark under its header). Vendored skills are marked only here: their files change only by update.

| Skill | Whose | What | Proof |

from and how to update it.
