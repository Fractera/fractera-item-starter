  Builder skill. How you prove that a change to this Fractera element works before you say «done» — the checks you plan
  before building, the two kinds of evidence every change needs, the spoil-and-restore control, the measurements that lie on
  this node, and what to say when a check cannot be run. Load it before every «done», «ready», «it works», «check it» about a
  page, a widget, a tool, a door, a style or any code of this element; when a check gives an unexpected answer; and when the
  person asks «did you test it?». Not for a worker job (an order for another agent) — that is checked by its own skill. The thing
  you cannot guess: a green build looks the same whether the feature works or not, and on this computer the owner passes every
  lock — a page that answers 200 to you may answer 401 to a visitor.

## Plan first

The checks are named in your confirming message before the work (CLAUDE.md, «Plan the checks before the work») and agreed
with the person. After the work you run exactly those — a check picked afterwards proves what was easy.

## Two kinds of evidence, both

| Kind | What | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **the machine** | the guards and the types | `npm run prebuild` — the **whole** chain, not one guard; `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` |
| **the behaviour** | what a visitor or the person gets | a live request with its answer; the page's HTML has the new `data-block`; a door answers the right code |

A build log is never the second kind: it reads the same whether the feature works or not.

## The control: spoil, see red, restore

For a rule you rely on (a guard, a lock, a fallback), break its input on purpose, see it refuse, put it back, see it pass, and
check `git status` is clean. A guard that stays green on a spoil watches nothing.

## Measurements that lie here

- **You are the owner at this machine:** `localhost` passes every lock as the architect. A lock is checked also as a stranger,
  through the public address (via Cloudflare it is not the owner): a door by `curl` without a session → 401/403; a page only in a
  private browser window — its HTML answers 200 to everyone (skill `use-auth`). No public address — say the check is not possible.
- **Page cache:** after `npm run pages:refresh` the first visit may still get the old page; request twice. On the own domain
  public pages come from the Cloudflare copy until «Deploy» or «Update copies» — a `curl` there proves the copy, not your change.
- **Code is in the build, data is live:** a code change is seen only in a new build (Preview before deploy); the live site
  still runs the old one (skill `deploy-element`).
- **`… | tail`** prints `tail`'s exit code: keep the command's own code (`; echo $?` right after it).
- **`localhost` vs `127.0.0.1`:** the core listens on `localhost` (IPv6 on Windows); a preview answers only on `127.0.0.1`.

## What you cannot check

A microphone, a click in the person's browser, an email that arrives — say plainly «not checked: …, check it this way: …».
Never replace it with an easier check and call it done.

## Then report

CLAUDE.md, «How you report»: each check, its line, what was not checked, and the links with `#block=`.
