# `/<lang>/finance/<slug>` — the child route of the finance branch

One file draws every page of `../_pages/`: `childRoute` from `lib/branch-page.tsx`. `generateStaticParams` returns `[]`
— the build draws no child; each is drawn on its first visit and kept for five minutes (`revalidate = 300`). An unknown
`<slug>` is a 404. The page's `meta.roles` puts a second lock on top of the branch lock.

**Do not add a file here.** A new page is a new folder in `../_pages/` — see `../README.md`.
## The rule of the frame

This element is built on Next 16.2 and grows only inside its frame (`CLAUDE.md`, section «The frame»). A branch has
code only at its root: `layout.tsx` + `page.tsx`, and one `[slug]/page.tsx` that draws every child. **A new page is a
folder of data in `_pages/`, never a new `page.tsx`** — the build grows with the number of route files, not pages
(measured: 300 page files 1252 s, the same pages through one template 98 s). `scripts/check-routes.mjs` fails the build
on any route file outside its closed list. Skill: `.claude/skills/use-page-tree`.

Pages are static: the build draws only the roots; a child is drawn on its first visit and refreshed every five minutes
(`revalidate = 300`). Texts are JSON read at run time (`lib/page-tree.ts`, `ELEMENT_DIR`): a corrected paragraph shows
up within five minutes without a rebuild. Every page has `en.json` (required) and `ru.json`; no visible string in code.
