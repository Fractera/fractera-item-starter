# Development documents of this element

How this element is being built. Written by the element's agent, in English, as the work happens.
The person's own words stay verbatim in quotes, with an English gist next to them.

Two files that describe the element live in the root, not here — programs read them by that path:
- `CLAUDE.md` — the agent's instruction (Claude Code loads it by itself).
- `OWN-SERVICE-PROPS/` — the passport (main door), its A2A card `A2A-CARD.json`; `NODE-CONTRACT.json` — what the node needs; integrations and cron.

Orders — work the element does for others over A2A — are not development and are not kept here.

## Documents

How to use them — what to read when, what to write on which event, how a step is planned and closed — is the skill
`use-development-docs`; two documents have their own skill, named in their row.

| File | What it holds | Who writes | When to open |
|---|---|---|---|
| `current-step.md` | where the work stands: the active step, the last commit, the next action, the person's latest decisions verbatim | the agent, on every event (skill `use-development-docs`) | **on every wake, first** |
| `steps-new/` | plans of steps not started yet: one file `<N>-<words>.md` per step | the agent, after the person agrees to the plan (skill `use-development-docs`) | when choosing what to do next |
| `steps-done/` | summaries of closed steps: what was done, the commit, the proof | the agent, when a step closes (skill `use-development-docs`) | when a task touches an area built before |
| `pre-steps/` | the intake: building requests from outside not started at once (the person mid-step, another agent over A2A, the core's task window); handled ones in `handled/` | the agent, recording the asker's words verbatim — the law is `pre-steps/README.md` | **on every wake, with `current-step.md`**; at the end of every substep |
| `anti-patterns.md` | dead ends already paid for: symptom, cause, cure | the agent, when a cause is found (skill `use-development-docs`) | before a build; when something fails |
| `proofs/` | one file per proof: how a part of `CLAUDE.md` or a skill was proven live (the method, the runs, the transcript evidence) and what stays unproven | the agent, right after a live proof (rules below, «Proof marks») | before changing a proven section; when deciding what to prove next |
| `owner-decisions-on-skill-changes.md` | what a self-review proposed and what the person answered, verbatim | skill `self-review` | before every self-review |
| `translation-debt.md` | texts left in one language while building: path, what, which languages it owes, why deferred | the agent, the same day a text is left untranslated (skill `use-languages`) | before translating; before launch in more languages |

## Proof marks

The instruction grows, and every part of it is proven live the way the first proof did (`proofs/2026-10-06-wake-and-a2a-skills.md`):
a real task, the person's own action, and the agent's session transcript showing what it actually ran. Reading the text is not a proof.
The person, verbatim: «иначе мы будем забывать что и когда доказали» (otherwise we forget what was proven and when).

- In `CLAUDE.md` a proven section sits between `<!-- PROOF N START · «<section>» · PROVEN|PARTIAL <date>: <what exactly> · report: <proofs file> -->`
  and `<!-- PROOF N END -->`. PARTIAL names what is proven and what is not. No marks — not proven.
- `N` only grows; a section that changes after its proof loses PROVEN until it is proven again (write PARTIAL or remove the marks
  in the same commit as the change).
- Every proof leaves its file in `proofs/` named `<date>-<what>.md`.
- Skills the same way, to tell working skills from skills under study: right under the header of our own `SKILL.md`
  `<!-- PROOF · PROVEN <date>: <what the live run showed> · report: <proofs file> -->` or `<!-- PROOF · NOT PROVEN yet … -->`;
  the table in `.claude/skills/README.md` has a «Proof» column for every skill, vendored ones too (their files change only by update).

## Rules

- A file in this folder that is not listed above is a defect: `npm run check:dev-docs` fails.
- English only; Cyrillic is allowed only inside quotes «…» or "…" (the person's words).
- Step numbers are this element's own, starting from 1.
